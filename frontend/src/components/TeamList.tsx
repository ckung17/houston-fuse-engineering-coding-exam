/**
 * TeamList Component
 * 
 * Your task: Build this component to display team members from the API.
 * 
 * Requirements:
 *   1. Fetch team members from GET http://localhost:3001/team
 *   2. Display each team member (name, role, department, email)
 *   3. Show a loading state while fetching
 *   4. Show an error state if the request fails
 *   5. Add a text input to filter by name
 *   6. Add a dropdown to filter by department
 * 
 * Helpful files:
 *   - src/types/team.ts - TypeScript types for the API response
 *   - src/api/team.ts - API helper function (optional to use)
 * 
 * Feel free to create additional components if you'd like!
